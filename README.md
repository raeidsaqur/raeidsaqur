:left_speech_bubble: I'm a 5th year Computer Science PhD (C) at the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Toronto (UofT) - currently in the process of finalizing my thesis. 

## üëã Quick Updates 

**Fall 2024:** I am visiting the [Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Oxford-Man Institute (OMI) for Quantitative Finance](https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/) for the Michaelmas term (Fall semester) 2024.

I aim to build on the recent collaborative work on [Stochastic Filtering-Based online filtering of a mixture of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02969) and tackle the associative challenges of: **(i)** consuming massive online spatio-temporal data by LLMs in real-time (representation learning (RepL)); **(ii)** dynamically mixing the outputs from any arbitrary mixture of heterogeneous experts (or, colloquially, agents or an agentic system) optimally.

**Winter 2024:** I am co-instructing [CSC401](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~raeidsaqur/csc401): Natural Language Computing (cross-listed with grad CSC2511) this semester (Winter 2024).
